## About this project

This is a tool that finds connections between things using AI, and ranks them.

It's is a strange project, and about the only use case I have for this is to help with writing jokes or rap.

I've found that it is better at producing left-field connections than standard ones.

## Why this project

I just kind of wanted to mess around with AI a bunch. I thought of this in the morning and wanted to see if I could build it in a day. I did :)
